This project aims at creating a **set** of *Netkit* Labs that can be interconnected with maximum interoperability.
Eventually this could allow one to easily test routing, or the impact of changes and failures, on relatively large network meshes simply by launching already designed network blocks.
Ideally, they **should** provide with a variety of different architectures and **peer** together to allow automatic reconfiguration and functionning with a limited number of nodes.

Please do not push pure configuration changes (as the nature and placement of connections are highly dependent on the testing environement needed) but rather try to expand with additional labs and services. The ip-alloc files and network diagrams should be updated appropriately.
